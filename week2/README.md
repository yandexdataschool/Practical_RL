## Homework description:

__warning!__ This homework assignment works on python2 only (as per now). If you stick to py3, consider alternative homework. Or just install it for this homework alone and remove afterwards.

__warning2!__ This homework will not work on binder VM / headless server. Please run it on laptop or consider ./alternative

* Go to ./assignment, edit __qlearningagents.py__ (see instructions inside)
* Make sure your agent beats ./run_crawler.sh 
* python crawler.py
 * on windows, just run `python crawler.py` from cmd in the project directory
* other ./run* files are mostly for your amusement. 
  * ./run_pacman.sh will need more epochs to converge

Alternative homework description:
* Go to [the notebook](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL/blob/master/week2/alternative/homework.ipynb)
* The assignment is described there.
* If you use binder/server, see week1 for example on how to run CartPole and other envs.
