    "\n",
    "We will use the code you just wrote extensively in the next week of our course. If you're feeling that you need more examples to understand how experience replay works, try using it for binarized state spaces (CartPole or other __[classic control envs](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#classic_control)__).\n",

    "__Next week__ we're gonna explore how q-learning and similar algorithms can be applied for large state spaces, with deep learning models to approximate the Q function.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, __the code you've written__ for this week is already capable of solving many RL problems, and as an added benifit - it is very easy to detach. You can use Q-learning, SARSA and Experience Replay for any RL problems you want to solve - just thow 'em into a file and import the stuff you need."
