    "* **TD loss** is the MSE between agent's current Q-values and target Q-values. It may slowly increase or decrease, it's ok. The \"not ok\" behavior includes going NaN or stayng at exactly zero before agent has perfect performance.\n",
    "* **grad norm** just shows the intensivity of training. Not ok is growing to values of about 100 (or maybe even 50) though it depends on network architecture.\n",
    "* **mean reward** is the expected sum of r(s,a) agent gets over the full game session. It will oscillate, but on average it should get higher over time (after a few thousand iterations...). \n",
    " * In basic q-learning implementation it takes about 40k steps to \"warm up\" agent before it starts to get better.\n",
    "* **Initial state V** is the expected discounted reward for episode in the oppinion of the agent. It should behave more smoothly than **mean reward**. It should get higher over time but sometimes can experience drawdowns because of the agaent's overestimates.\n",
    "* **buffer size** - this one is simple. It should go up and cap at max size.\n",
    "* **epsilon** - agent's willingness to explore. If you see that agent's already at 0.01 epsilon before it's average reward is above 0 - it means you need to increase epsilon. Set it back to some 0.2 - 0.5 and decrease the pace at which it goes down.\n",

    "The task has something in common with supervised learning: loss is optimized through the buffer (instead of Train dataset). But the distribution of states and actions in the buffer **is not stationary** and depends on the policy that generated it. It can even happen that the mean TD error across the buffer is very low but the performance is extremely poor (imagine the agent collecting data to the buffer always manages to avoid the ball).\n",

    "* Total timesteps and training time: It seems to be so huge, but actually it is normal for RL.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\epsilon$ decay shedule was taken from the original paper and is like traditional for epsilon-greedy policies. At the beginning of the training the agent's greedy policy is poor so many random actions should be taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Optimizer: In the original paper RMSProp was used (they did not have Adam in 2013) and it can work not worse than Adam. For us Adam was default and it worked.\n",
    "\n",
    "* lr: $10^{-3}$ would probably be too huge\n",
    "\n",
    "* batch size: This one can be very important: if it is too small the agent can fail to learn. Huge batch takes more time to process. If batch of size 8 can not be processed on the hardware you use take 2 (or even 4) batches of size 4, divide the loss on them by 2 (or 4) and make optimization step after both backward() calls in torch.\n",
    "\n",
    "* target network update frequency: has something in common with learning rate. Too frequent updates can lead to divergence. Too rare can lead to slow leraning. For millions of total timesteps thousands of inner steps seem ok. One iteration of target network updating is an iteration of the (this time approximate) $\\gamma$-compression that stands behind Q-learning. The more inner steps it makes the more accurate is the compression.\n",
