    "By this moment you should have got enough score on [CartPole-v0](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0) to consider it solved (see the link). It's time to upload the result and get to something harder.\n",

    "  * Obvious improvement: use [joblib](https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=joblib&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8)\n",
    "  * Try re-using samples from 3-5 last iterations when computing threshold and training\n",

    "* Gym page: [mountaincar](https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCar-v0), [lunarlander](https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLander-v2)\n",
    "* Sessions for MountainCar may last for 10k+ ticks. Make sure ```t_max``` param is at least 10k.\n",
    " * Also it may be a good idea to cut rewards via \">\" and not \">=\". If 90% of your sessions get reward of -10k and 20% are better, than if you use percentile 20% as threshold, R >= threshold __fails cut off bad sessions__ whule R > threshold works alright.\n",
    "* _issue with gym_: Some versions of gym limit game time by 200 ticks. This will prevent cem training in most cases. Make sure your agent is able to play for the specified __t_max__, and if it isn't, try `env = gym.make(\"MountainCar-v0\").env` or otherwise get rid of TimeLimit wrapper.\n",
    "* If you use old _swig_ lib for LunarLander-v2, you may get an error. See this [issue](https://github.com/openai/gym/issues/100) for solution.\n",
    "* If it won't train it's a good idea to plot reward distribution and record sessions: they may give you some clue. If they don't, call course staff :)\n",
    "* 20-neuron network is probably not enough, feel free to experiment.\n",
    "* __Please upload the results to openai gym and send links to all submissions in the e-mail__\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "* __2.3 bonus__ Try to find a network architecture and training params that solve __both__ environments above (_Points depend on implementation. If you attempted this task, please mention it in anytask submission._)\n",
    "\n",
    "* __2.4 bonus__ Solve continuous action space task with `MLPRegressor` or similar.\n",
    "  * Start with [\"Pendulum-v0\"](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Pendulum-v0).\n",
    "  * Since your agent only predicts the \"expected\" action, you will have to add noise to ensure exploration.\n",
    "  * [MountainCarContinuous-v0](https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCarContinuous-v0), [LunarLanderContinuous-v2](https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLanderContinuous-v2) \n",
    "  * 4 points for solving. Slightly less for getting some results below solution threshold. Note that discrete and continuous environments may have slightly different rules aside from action spaces.\n",
