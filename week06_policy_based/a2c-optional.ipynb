    "\n",
    "You may recall a technique called \"target networks\" we used a few weeks ago when we trained a DQN agent to play Atari Breakout and wonder why we have not suggested using them here. The answer is that this is more historical than practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the \"chasing the target\" problem is still present in actor-critic value estimation and target networks do show up in follow-up papers, the original A3C/A2C papers do not mention them and do not explain this omission.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis why this may not be a big deal (compared to Q-learning) goes like this. An A3C/A2C agent selects actions based on policy, not an epsilon greedy exploration function, for which the argmax can change drastically due to tiny errors in function approximation. Therefore, errors in the value target caused by target chasing will cause less damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the actor-critic gradient relies on the advantage function $A(s_t, a_t) = Q(s_t, a_t) - V(s_t)$. Compare this to the $Q$-function $Q(s_t, a_t) = r(s_t, a_t) + \\gamma \\cdot \\mathbb{E}_{s_{t+1} \\mid s_t, a_t} V(s_{t+1})$ used in Q-learning and SARSA: we would expect that any bias in $V$-function approximation will be carried over from $V(s_{t+1})$ to $V(s_t)$ by gradient updates. However, in the formula for the advantage function the two approximations ($Q$-function and $V$-function) come with opposite signs, and thus the errors will cancel out.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last reason may be computational. Authors were concerned to beat existent algorithms in the wall-clock learning time, and any overhead of parameter copying (target network update) counted against this goal."
