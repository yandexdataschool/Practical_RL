  * Note: UCB-1 is not for bernoulli rewards, but for arbitrary r in [0,1], so you can just scale any reward to [0,1] to obtain a peace of mind. It's derived directly from Hoeffding's inequality.

## Seminar
In this seminar, you'll be implementing Bayesian UCB and Thompson Sampling for a contextual bandit based on Bayesian Neural Networks. Everything's in the notebook!
