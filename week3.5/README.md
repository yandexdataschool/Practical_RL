* Srsly, just google `"deep learning %s"%s for s in what_you_want_to_know`.

## Homework
Again, two options:

If you are already familiar with lasagne or you are super-good with tensorflow/pytorch/similar, pick the _alternative_ option. Otherwise we highly recommend the first one as we'll need convolutional networks soon enough.

* [__recommended__] Either go to Seminar3.5-*-mnist.ipynb and follow the instructions (ends with lasagne MNIST classifier)
* [__alternative__] Or go to Seminar3.5-approx-q-learning.ipynb and follow the instructions (ends with simple NN for q-learning)
