It's also OK if it doesn't increase substantially before some 10-20k initial steps, and some people who tried this assignment [told us](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-rl/discussions/all/threads/3OnFNVxEEemLZA644RFX2A) they didn't see improvements until around 60k steps. However, if reward reaches zero and doesn't seem to get up over 2-3 evaluations, there's something wrong happening.\n",

    "Since we use a policy-based method, we also keep track of __policy entropy__ â€” the same one you used as a regularizer. The only important thing about it is that your entropy shouldn't drop too low (`< 0.1`) before your agent gets the yellow belt. Or at least it can drop there, but _it shouldn't stay there for long_.\n",
