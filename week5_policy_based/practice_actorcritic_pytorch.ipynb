    "\n",
    "1. All rewards are multiples of 100, and even an untrained agent can get a score of 800. Therefore, even in the beginning of training, the critic will have to predict pretty large numbers. Neural networks require extra tinkering to output large numbers reliably. In this case, the easiest workaround is just to scale back those numbers.\n",

    "Please note however that we would not have needed to do this in plain REINFORCE without entropy regularization but with Adam optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In REINFORCE, there is only actor and no critic. Without entropy regularization, actor loss is just policy gradient. It is proportional to rewards, but it only affects the scale of the gradient. However, Adam maintains a running average of the variance of the gradient for each parameter it optimizes, and normalizes the gradient by its variance in each optimization step. This will negate any scaling of the gradient.\n",

However, if reward reaches zero and doesn't seem to get up over 2-3 evaluations, there's something wrong happening.\n",
