    "This time we'll solve a problem of transribing hebrew words in english, also known as g2p (grapheme2phoneme)\n",
    "\n",
    " * word (sequence of letters in source language) -> translation (sequence of letters in target language)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike most deep learning practicioners do, we won't only train it to maximize likelihood of correct translation, but also employ reinforcement learning to actually teach it to translate with as few errors as possible.\n",

    "\n",
    "### About the task\n",
    "\n",
    "One notable property of Hebrew is that it's consonant language. That is, there are no wovels in the written language. One could represent wovels with diacritics above consonants, but you don't expect people to do that in everyay life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, some hebrew characters will correspond to several english letters and others - to none, so we should use encoder-decoder architecture to figure that out.\n",
    "\n",

    "Encoder-decoder architectures are about converting anything to anything, including\n",
    " * Machine translation and spoken dialogue systems\n",
    " * [Image captioning](http://mscoco.org/dataset/#captions-challenge2015) and [image2latex](https://openai.com/requests-for-research/#im2latex) (convolutional encoder, recurrent decoder)\n",
    " * Generating [images by captions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02793) (recurrent encoder, convolutional decoder)\n",
    " * Grapheme2phoneme - convert words to transcripts\n",
    "  \n",
    "We chose simplified __Hebrew->English__ machine translation for words and short phrases (character-level), as it is relatively quick to train even without a gpu cluster."

    "* There's more than one way of sending information from encoder to decoder, especially if there's more than one layer:\n",
    "  * __Vanilla:__ layer_i of encoder last state goes to layer_i of decoder initial state\n",
    "  * __Intermediate layers:__ add dense (and possibly concat) layers between encoder last and decoder first.\n",
    "  * __Every tick:__ feed encoder last state _on every iteration_ of decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* It's often useful to save pre-trained model parameters to not re-train it every time you want new policy gradient parameters. \n",
    "* When leaving training for nighttime, try setting REPORT_FREQ to a larger value (e.g. 500) not to waste time on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* (advanced deep learning) It may be a good idea to first train on small phrases and then adapt to larger ones (a.k.a. training curriculum).\n",
    "* (advanced nlp) You may want to switch from raw utf8 to something like unicode or even syllables to make task easier.\n",
    "* (advanced nlp) Since hebrew words are written __with vowels omitted__, you may want to use a small Hebrew vowel markup dataset at `he-pron-wiktionary.txt`.\n",
