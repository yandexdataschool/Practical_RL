    "* `print_policy` function was built for the frozenlake-v0 env so it will break on any other env. You could simply ignore it or rewrite it for your env.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Bonus I (2 points):\n",
    "* Gym envs have a condition for \"beating the game\". E.g. here's the conditions for [Taxi-v1](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Taxi-v1). \n",
    "* If you managed to do that, it's worth uploading your first solution to gym. See `gym.upload(...)` docs. Allbeit it isn't a strong AI (or is it?), uploading your algorithm would be a good start. (and a +point!)\n",
    "* You'll get __+1 point__ for uploading and __+1 more if you beat the game__\n",

    "### Bonus II (4 points):\n",
    "* There are environments with continuous state spaces. In fact, most real world environments have this property. While we will dive into methods designed for that later, right now you already can solve them through binarization.\n",
    " * Gym has a basic infinite-state-space env called [CartPole](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0) - please start from this one. Solving something more challenging is great, but make sure your algorithm beats cartpole first. Also kudos for submitting.\n",
    " * Main idea: if you have something infinite and you want something discrete, you split it into bins. Like what histogram does.\n",
